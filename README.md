MNIST Dataset Overview
What is the MNIST Dataset?
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. It's widely used in the field of machine learning and computer vision for benchmarking classification algorithms.

Dataset Specifications
Content: The dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
Image Size: Each image is 28x28 pixels, represented in a grayscale format.
Split: Typically, the dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, allowing for robust training and evaluation of models.
Historical Background
Here is the wikipage of MNIST dataset please go through it.

We will be using popular deep learning framework tensorflow to complete this activity. First let's load the dataset from tensorflow.keras.datasets and display some instances from the dataset.
