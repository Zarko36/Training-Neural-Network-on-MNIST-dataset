MNIST Dataset Overview
What is the MNIST Dataset?
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. It's widely used in the field of machine learning and computer vision for benchmarking classification algorithms.

Dataset Specifications
Content: The dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
Image Size: Each image is 28x28 pixels, represented in a grayscale format.
Split: Typically, the dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, allowing for robust training and evaluation of models.
Historical Background
Here is the wikipage of MNIST dataset please go through it.

We will be using popular deep learning framework tensorflow to complete this activity. First let's load the dataset from tensorflow.keras.datasets and display some instances from the dataset.

# Understanding Neural Networks
Neural networks are a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of deep learning. They are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, especially in how neurons process and transmit information.

# What is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In essence, it is a system of interconnected units (neurons) that work together to process and analyze data.

# How Do Neural Networks Work?
Neural networks operate on layers of neurons. Each neuron in a layer is connected to neurons in the previous and next layers. These connections have associated weights and biases, which are adjusted during the training process.
